# First Sale Guide for the Smart Invoice Follow-Up System

**Goal:** Help you make your *very first* dollar from this system without needing to “be good at sales.”

You don’t need a website, a funnel, or fancy email campaigns to start. You just need:

- One clear, simple offer  
- A short list of real humans who might benefit  
- A low-pressure way to talk about it  

This guide walks you through that step by step.

---

## 1. Define the Smallest Possible Offer

Don’t sell “the whole vision” yet. Make it tiny and concrete.

**Working offer (you can use this as-is):**

> “I’ll set up an automated invoice follow‑up system in your Google Sheets + Gmail so you get paid faster, and I’ll walk you through how to use it. One-time, fixed price.”

**For the first 1–3 clients:**

- **Scope (what’s included):**
  - Connect *one* Google Sheet that tracks invoices
  - Connect *one* Gmail account
  - Standard 6‑stage follow‑up sequence (what you’ve already built)
  - Light customization of email language (a few phrases in their tone)
  - One 45–60 minute “show you how it works” call

- **Price (start easy, not “perfect”):**
  - Pick a number you feel **zero resistance** saying out loud.
  - Example starter prices:
    - **$500** “founder’s beta” price (very safe)
    - Later you can move to **$1,500–$2,500** once you have 1–2 results.

- **Timeline:**
  - “We’ll have it live in **7 days** from when you pay and send me access.”

You can literally say:

> “I’m offering a one-time setup where I connect your Google Sheets + Gmail so overdue invoices automatically get follow‑up drafts created for you. You review and send.  
> For this first round I’m charging **$500** as a beta price while I refine it.”

You can change the number later. The important thing is that **you can say it without flinching**.

## 2. Pick 3–5 Real People (Not “The Market”)

Forget trying to “launch” to the whole internet. Your first dollar almost always comes from someone you already know (or one or two connections away).

Open a notes app or paper and list **3–5 people** who:

- Run a service business (agency, consulting, design/dev, etc.)
- Send invoices of at least a few hundred dollars
- Have more than a tiny handful of clients
- Have ever complained about:
  - Late payments
  - Chasing invoices
  - Cash flow stress

Examples of who qualifies:

- Friend who runs a small marketing / design agency
- Former colleague doing freelance dev or consulting
- Somebody on LinkedIn who posted about “clients paying late”

**Write their names down.** That’s your “market” for now.

## 3. How to Reach Out (Simple Messages)

You are **not** doing mass cold email. You’re sending **1:1 human messages**.

Pick whichever channel feels most natural for each person:

- Email  
- LinkedIn DM  
- Slack / text / Messenger if you actually talk there  

### 3.1. Message for someone you know (warm)

Adapt this to sound like you:

> Subject: Quick question about overdue invoices  
>  
> Hey [Name],  
>  
> Random question about your business — do you ever get stuck chasing late invoices or waiting way too long to get paid?  
>  
> I’ve been building a little system that uses Google Sheets + Gmail to automate invoice follow‑up (it creates drafts for you to review, not auto‑send). I originally built it for a consulting firm that was sitting on a big pile of overdue invoices.  
>  
> If you’re open to it, I’d love to hop on a 15‑minute Zoom sometime this week and just show you what it does and get your honest take on whether it’s actually useful in the real world.  
>  
> If not, totally fine — just curious how you handle this now.  
>  
> – [Your Name]

### 3.2. Message for a looser contact (LinkedIn / acquaintance)

> Subject: Quick idea for [Their Company] cash flow  
>  
> Hey [Name],  
>  
> Saw you’re running [Their Company] – looks awesome. I’m experimenting with a small tool that automates invoice follow‑up using Google Sheets + Gmail (creates drafts for you, not auto‑send) to help service businesses get paid faster.  
>  
> Is chasing overdue invoices / waiting on payments a thing for you at all, or do you feel like you’ve got that dialed in?  
>  
> If it is a headache, I’m looking for 1–2 people to show it to and get blunt feedback. Happy to give you a quick 15‑minute walkthrough and you can tell me if it’s worth anything.  
>  
> – [Your Name]

Your goal with these is **not** “to sell them” — it’s to create **3 short conversations**.

## 4. The 15‑Minute Call Script (Low Pressure)

If someone says “sure” or “yeah, that’s an issue,” send something like:

> “Awesome — I’ll keep it to 15 minutes and just walk you through what I’ve built. If it’s not useful, no hard feelings.  
> Here’s my calendar: [Calendly link]  
> Or if you prefer, tell me a couple of times that work for you.”

On the call, think of it as **a user interview + demo**, not a “sales call.”

### 4.1. Part 1 – Understand their world (5 minutes)

Ask simple questions and listen:

- “How are you handling overdue invoices right now?”  
- “What’s the annoying part of that for you?”  
- “Any rough idea how much you usually have outstanding at any given time?”

Your job is just to understand:

- Their current system  
- Their pain level  
- The size of the problem (ballpark: $5k outstanding? $50k? etc.)  

### 4.2. Part 2 – Show your system (5–7 minutes)

You don’t need a perfect polished demo. Just show:

1. **The Google Sheet**  
   - “This is where invoices live — this can look a lot like what you already use.”  
   - Show the “Overdue” status column.  

2. **The email sequence / templates**  
   - “Here are the 6 stages — starts friendly, gradually gets firmer.”  
   - Emphasize: “This creates **drafts** in your Gmail. You still review/edit/decide to send.”  

3. **What happens daily**  
   - “Once a day, it looks at your sheet, figures out what’s overdue, and creates the right drafts in Gmail. You open Drafts, review, and click Send. 5 minutes.”  

Connect what you’re showing back to what they told you:

- “You mentioned hating to remember who to follow up with — this is the part that removes that mental load.”  

### 4.3. Part 3 – Ask if it would actually help (2–3 minutes)

Simple question:

> “If this were running in your account right now, do you feel like it would actually make your life easier / speed up getting paid? Or is this more of a ‘nice idea but not worth changing anything’?”

If they say **“yeah, this would help”**, you can move to the offer:

> “Cool. I’m looking for 1–2 early users to run this with.  
> For this beta round, I’ll set it up in your Google Sheets + Gmail, customize the email language to your tone, and make sure it’s working end‑to‑end.  
> I’m charging **$500 one‑time** for that right now.  
>  
> Does that feel reasonable given what we talked about?”

If they say “I need to think” or “not right now,” that’s totally fine — you’ve just gained signal about the offer and your demo.

## 5. Handling Common Reactions (Without Being Pushy)

You don’t need to “overcome objections.” You just need a calm response that either:

- Clarifies value, **or**  
- Gracefully lets them go while learning something  

### “That’s more than I was expecting right now”

> “Totally fair.  
> Just to sanity‑check — you mentioned you usually have around $[X] outstanding and some of it never gets collected.  
> If this prevented even one $[their typical invoice size] invoice from slipping through, it would more than pay for itself.  
>  
> That said, I don’t want to push you into something that doesn’t feel right. Would it help if I wrote up a short summary with numbers so you can think about it and decide?”

### “I don’t have time to set something new up”

> “I get that. The nice thing is it uses Google Sheets + Gmail you already use. Setup on your side is mostly: invite me to the sheet, approve Google, and then a 1‑hour call where I walk you through everything.  
> After that it’s 5 minutes a day reviewing drafts.  
>  
> If that still feels like too much right now, that’s useful for me to know too.”

If they’re still hesitant, **you can let it go**:

> “No worries at all — this has been really helpful feedback. I’ll keep refining it and if I make a version that’s more plug‑and‑play I can check back in, if you’d like.”

You’re playing the long game. One honest “no” is better than a forced “yes” that turns into a headache.

## 6. Simple Tracking So You Don’t Feel Lost

Make a **single tab in a Google Sheet** called `sales-tracking`.

**Columns:**

- Date  
- Name  
- Company  
- Contact Method (Email / LinkedIn / etc.)  
- Stage (`Contacted`, `Replied`, `Demo Booked`, `Won`, `Lost`)  
- Notes (1 short sentence)

**Daily (5–10 minutes):**

- Add anyone you messaged
- Update stages (e.g., `Contacted → Replied`, `Demo Booked`, etc.)

**Weekly (15–20 minutes):**

Look at the sheet and ask:

- How many people did I contact this week?  
- How many replied?  
- How many demos did I run?  
- What kind of person seemed most interested?  

Use that to make tiny adjustments:

- “Agencies are clicking, solo freelancers aren’t → focus more on agencies.”  
- “Warm intros work better than random LinkedIn → spend more time there.”  

You’re not optimizing a funnel; you’re just **learning from small numbers**.

---

## 7. When You Get a “Yes”

If someone says “yeah, let’s do it”:

1. **Confirm clearly in writing**
   - “Awesome. To recap, I’ll set up the invoice follow‑up system in your Google Sheets + Gmail, customize the emails, and walk you through it. One‑time price: **$500**. We’ll aim to have it live within 7 days.”

2. **Send an invoice**
   - Use whatever tool you already use (PayPal, Stripe, Wave, etc.).
   - Description: “Smart Invoice Follow‑Up Workflow – One‑Time Setup”

3. **Schedule the setup call**
   - “Once the invoice is paid, I’ll send over a short checklist and we’ll book a 60‑minute setup call.”

4. **Deliver, then capture a quote**
   - After they’ve used it for a couple weeks, ask:
     - “Has this made invoice follow‑up easier or faster for you yet? Any numbers you can share?”  
   - Turn their answer into a short case study using the template in `SALES_STRATEGY.md`.

That one story becomes the **anchor** for higher pricing and easier sales later.

## 8. What to Do *Right Now* (If You Want to Try)

If you want to leave this project “on the shelf” for later, that’s fine. When you’re ready, your first steps are:

1. Open this file and **re‑read sections 1–3** (offer, people, messages).  
2. Write down **3 names** who might be a fit.  
3. Send **one** message today (pick the least scary person).  

Nothing else needs to happen yet.

If you want, when you’re ready to try that first message, you can paste me:

- Who the person is (roughly: “runs a 3‑person marketing agency, always busy, ~\$X invoices outstanding”)  
- The draft message you *wish* you could send  

And I’ll help you tighten it so it feels like you and is safe to send.  

You don’t have to become “a sales person.” You just have to talk to a few people you can actually help. This guide is here so you don’t have to remember how. 💸
