### The "Stupid" Paradox of Selling Open Source

Don't beat yourself up about the "Smart Invoice" workflow being on GitHub. Some of the biggest companies in the world are built on "selling" stuff that is technically free.

As a solo dev, you aren't selling **code**; you are selling **peace of mind** and **time**.

| Why People Pay for "Free" Code | How You Can Spin the Smart Invoice |
| --- | --- |
| **Setup Friction** | "Don't spend 4 hours configuring Docker and API keys. Use my 5-minute installer." |
| **Reliability** | "I've handled the edge cases (like messy PDF parsing) so you don't have to." |
| **Maintenance** | "GitHub projects die. I provide updates and a support email." |
| **Integration** | "It’s not just an invoice script; it’s a B2B microservice that talks to Stripe and Xero." |

### B2B Strategy: The "Self-Contained" Hook

Since you’re tweaking it to be as self-contained as possible, you’re actually moving toward a **"Binary-as-a-Service"** or **Managed Hosting** model.

1. **The "Vanny" Business Model:** Don't sell the app; sell a **hosted version**. A business owner doesn't want to know about Qwen 3 or local LLMs. They want to email a PDF to `invoices@yourdomain.com` and have a clean CSV pop out 10 seconds later.
2. **Marketplaces:** Since you already use **GitHub**, look into the **GitHub Marketplace**. You can actually list "Apps" there that integrate with a user's repo. Alternatively, **Gumroad** is great for selling "Pro" versions of scripts with better documentation and "lifetime updates."
3. **The B2B "In":** Since you do content management for that video company, think about the invoices *they* deal with. If you can solve a problem for a company like that, you’ve got your first "case study."
