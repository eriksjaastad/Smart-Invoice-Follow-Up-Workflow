## Pricing Strategy

### Option 1: One-Time Setup (Recommended to Start)

**$2,500 - $5,000 one-time**

**Includes:**
- Complete system setup
- Google Sheets template configured
- Gmail integration
- 6 custom email templates (in their voice)
- Training session (1 hour)
- 30 days of support

**Why this works:**
- No ongoing commitment for them
- You get paid upfront
- Easy to explain ROI
- Lower friction than subscription

### Option 2: Monthly SaaS (Scale Later)

**$99 - $299/month**

**Includes:**
- Hosted solution (you run it for them)
- Monthly reports
- Template updates
- Ongoing support

**Pros:**
- Recurring revenue
- Predictable income
- Easier for small businesses

**Cons:**
- Requires you to host/maintain
- Takes longer to get paid
- More support overhead

### Option 3: Hybrid (Best of Both)

**$1,500 setup + $99/month support**

**Setup fee:**
- System installation
- Customization
- Training

**Monthly fee:**
- Ongoing support
- Template updates
- Priority assistance

### My Recommendation: Start with Option 1

**Why:**
- Get $2,500 cash immediately
- Prove the system works
- Build case studies
- Scale to SaaS later

**Price it based on their outstanding invoices:**
- $10k-$25k outstanding → $2,500
- $25k-$50k outstanding → $3,500
- $50k+ outstanding → $5,000

They'll pay for itself in the first month if it collects just ONE invoice faster.

## Email Templates

### Template 1: Warm Intro (Someone You Know)

**Subject:** Quick idea for [THEIR COMPANY] cash flow

```
Hey [NAME],

Hope you're doing well! I was thinking about our conversation where you mentioned clients taking forever to pay invoices.

I just built something that might help: an automated invoice follow-up system that cuts collection time from 45+ days to ~18 days.

It's basically a 6-stage email sequence that runs on autopilot (but creates drafts for you to review, not auto-sends). Saved a consulting firm 6-8 hours per week and freed up $29k in cash flow in the first month.

Want to see how it works? I can show you in 15 minutes.

[YOUR NAME]

P.S. - It integrates with Google Sheets and Gmail, so no new software to learn.
```

### Template 2: Cold Outreach (LinkedIn Connection)

**Subject:** [THEIR COMPANY] - Invoice collection idea

```
Hi [NAME],

I saw you run [THEIR COMPANY] - congrats on [RECENT MILESTONE from their LinkedIn].

Quick question: how much time does your team spend chasing down overdue invoices each week?

I built an automated system that cuts invoice collection time by ~60% while saving 6-8 hours per week. It works with Google Sheets + Gmail, so no new tools to learn.

A consulting firm I worked with freed up $29,375 in the first 30 days just by following up systematically.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits your workflow?

[YOUR NAME]

P.S. - Creates email drafts (not auto-sends), so you keep full control.
```

### Template 3: Value-First (Giving Away Insights)

**Subject:** The 6-stage invoice collection sequence that works

```
Hi [NAME],

I noticed you run [THEIR BUSINESS TYPE]. I recently helped a [SIMILAR BUSINESS] reduce their invoice collection time from 45+ days to 18 days.

Here's the exact 6-stage sequence they use:
- Day 7: Friendly check-in
- Day 14: Direct follow-up
- Day 21: Urgent reminder
- Day 28: Firm tone + call suggestion
- Day 35: Final warning
- Day 42: Collections notice

The key is consistency - most businesses are too busy to follow up systematically, so they lose ~20% of invoices that never get collected.

I built an automated version of this (Google Sheets + Gmail) that runs on autopilot. Creates drafts for you to review (not auto-sends).

Want to see how it works for [THEIR COMPANY]?

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Template 4: Follow-Up (They Didn't Respond)

**Subject:** Re: [THEIR COMPANY] - Invoice collection idea

```
Hey [NAME],

Following up on my message from last week about invoice collection automation.

I get it - your inbox is probably slammed. But here's why this is worth 15 minutes:

If you have $25k in outstanding invoices (conservative for most [THEIR INDUSTRY] firms), and we can collect 60% faster, that's ~$15k freed up in the first month.

That's life-changing cash flow for most businesses.

Quick call this week to show you how it works?

[YOUR NAME]

P.S. - If you're not interested, just let me know and I'll stop bothering you :)
```

## Sales Scripts

### The 15-Minute Demo Call

**Your opening (first 2 minutes):**

"Hey [NAME], thanks for hopping on! So you mentioned you're dealing with [THEIR PAIN POINT]. Let me show you exactly how this works and you can tell me if it's a fit.

The system is basically a 6-stage email sequence that automatically creates Gmail drafts based on how overdue an invoice is. You review them once a day and click send.

The result? Most clients go from 45+ days to collect down to about 18 days, and save 6-8 hours a week on manual follow-up.

Let me share my screen and walk you through it..."

**Demo flow (10 minutes):**

1. **Show Google Sheet** (2 min)
   - "This is where you track invoices - same workflow you probably use now"
   - Point out the status column: "Overdue" triggers the automation

2. **Show email templates** (3 min)
   - "Here are the 6 stages - starts friendly, gets firmer"
   - "We customize these to match YOUR voice and brand"
   - Emphasize: "Creates DRAFTS, never auto-sends"

3. **Show the results** (3 min)
   - "This consulting firm had $47k outstanding"
   - "Freed up $29k in 30 days just by following up consistently"
   - "Saved 24 hours a month - that's $4,800 at a $200/hour rate"

4. **Show the tracking** (2 min)
   - "System tracks what stage you sent, prevents duplicates"
   - "You get a daily report of what drafts were created"

**Closing (last 3 minutes):**

"So that's it. Pretty straightforward. What questions do you have?"

*[Answer questions]*

"So here's how this works: I charge [$2,500] for the complete setup, including:
- System installation and configuration
- Your Google Sheets template customized
- All 6 email templates written in YOUR voice
- 1-hour training session
- 30 days of support

And honestly, if this saves you even ONE $5,000 invoice from going to collections, it pays for itself immediately.

Want to move forward?"

### Objection Handlers

**"That's too expensive"**

→ "I get it. But let me ask: how much do you have in outstanding invoices right now? [THEY ANSWER]. And what percentage of those typically never get collected? [THEY ANSWER ~15-20%]. So you're potentially losing [$X] this year just from invoices that slip through the cracks. This system pays for itself if it collects just ONE invoice 30 days faster. Does that make sense?"

**"I don't have time to learn a new system"**

→ "That's exactly why this works - it uses Google Sheets and Gmail, which you're already using. No new software. The setup takes 1 hour, then you spend 5 minutes a day reviewing drafts. Compare that to the 6-8 hours a week you're spending now chasing invoices."

**"Can I just build this myself?"**

→ "Absolutely! I actually have the full technical documentation if you want it. But here's the thing: how much is your time worth? If you're billing at [$X/hour], it'll take you 10-15 hours to build this, test it, and get it working. That's [$THEIR RATE × 15] in lost billable time. Or you can have it running by Friday for $2,500. Your call."

**"I need to think about it"**

→ "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think about? [THEY ANSWER]. Okay, so if we can address [THAT CONCERN], would you be ready to move forward? What if I [OFFER TO SOLVE THEIR SPECIFIC CONCERN]?"

**"We already have someone chasing invoices"**

→ "Perfect! So you're already paying someone to do this manually. How many hours a week does that take? [THEY ANSWER]. At [$THEIR EMPLOYEE COST/hour], that's [$X/month] in labor costs. This system costs [$YOUR PRICE] one-time, runs forever, and never takes a vacation. Plus your person can focus on actually valuable work instead of sending 'just checking in' emails."

**"What if clients get annoyed by automated emails?"**

→ "Great question. That's why it creates DRAFTS, not auto-sends. You review every email before it goes out. And honestly? Clients expect to be reminded about overdue invoices. The professional, consistent follow-up actually improves your relationship because they know where they stand. It's worse when you DON'T follow up and then surprise them with a collections notice."

## ROI Calculator

### Simple Version (Use on Calls)

**Formula:**
```
Current outstanding invoices × 0.15 (typical uncollected %) = Annual losses
If system costs $2,500 and prevents just 1 loss, it pays for itself
```

**Example:**
- Outstanding invoices: $50,000
- Typical uncollected rate: 15%
- Annual loss: $7,500
- System cost: $2,500
- **ROI: 200% if it prevents just 33% of losses**

### Detailed Version (For Proposals)

**Time Savings:**
```
Current time spent chasing invoices: 6 hours/week
× 52 weeks = 312 hours/year
× Your hourly rate ($200) = $62,400/year in opportunity cost

After automation: 0.5 hours/week
× 52 weeks = 26 hours/year
× $200 = $5,200/year

Annual time savings value: $57,200
System cost: $2,500
ROI: 2,288%
```

**Cash Flow Improvement:**
```
Current avg collection time: 45 days
After system: 18 days
Improvement: 27 days faster

If you invoice $100k/year:
- $100k ÷ 12 months = $8,333/month
- 27 days = ~$7,500 freed up continuously

That's $7,500 you can reinvest or use to cover expenses while waiting for payment.
```

## The Simple Sales Process

### Step-by-Step (What You Actually Do)

**Day 1: Send 20 Emails**

- Use Template 2 for cold LinkedIn connections
- Use Template 3 for people who posted about cash flow
- Takes 2 hours max

**Day 3: Follow Up**
- Send Template 4 to non-responders
- 15 minutes

**Day 5-7: Book Demo Calls**
- When they respond, send: "Great! Here's my calendar: [CALENDLY LINK]"

### The Math

**20 emails sent**
→ 5 replies (25% response rate)
→ 3 demo calls booked (60% of replies)
→ 1 sale (33% close rate)
→ $2,500 revenue

**To make $10k/month:**
- Need 4 sales @ $2,500
- Need 12 demos
- Need 20 replies
- Need 80 emails sent
- **4 emails per day = $10k/month**

**To make $25k/month:**
- Need 10 sales

But here's the thing: you built something valuable. This system solves a real problem (cash flow) and delivers measurable results ($29k in 30 days, 6-8 hours saved weekly).

**You're not selling. You're helping.**

Every business you reach out to ACTUALLY HAS THIS PROBLEM. You're offering them a solution that will make their life better.

Then do it again tomorrow.
